## Future developments

Some of the key future developments are as follows:



## Testing 
Throughout the course of testing the following key test areas were focused on:

**Functional**





**Code validator testing**






**Bugs**

  **Fixed Bugs**
  
  - at some stage of development it was identified that user input validation, specifically when user select the same letter again, was not functoning correctly. This has been       subsequently resolved through code correction.
  - it was also identified that a space in front of underscore (representing each letter of the word) was causing a distorted view for the user as to what the actual length of       the word. This was resolved by removing a space in front of underscore character to correct visibility of the letter placeholders.
  - 
  
  **Unfixed Bugs**
  
  -at the time of the deployment of the project the validation of the user input, whereby the user includes numeric value, still remains unresolved due to time constraints.

2. Click on the "NEW APPLICATION" and create an App name and choose your region (Europe for this project)
3. Click on "Deploy" and choose your deployment method
4. If you are connecting with Github choose your main branch and find your repository
5. Add config vars PORT = 8000 and buildpacks python and nodejs
6. Click on deploy manually or automatically (automaticlaly for this project)
7. When selecting Automatic deploayment, Deploy Branch still needs to be selected also.
8. The project has now been deployed
9. When deployed click on View on the bottom of the page
